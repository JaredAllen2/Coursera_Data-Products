# Week 3 Peer-graded assessment

##
An exploration of gen1 Pokemon through the medium of plotly graphs

A database of the Gen1 pokemon was borrowed from github for the purpose of this analysis:

```{r dta_import, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pokemon_gen1 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgreski/pokemonData/master/gen01.csv")

head(pokemon_gen1)

```


## Graph of Pokemon statistics - Attack, Defense, Speed, HP and Principal Type

```{r pokemon_graph, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(data=pokemon_gen1, type = 'scatter3d', mode = 'markers', x=~Attack, y=~Defense, z=~Speed, size=~HP, color=~Type1)

```
